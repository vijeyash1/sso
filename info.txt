  After running the code, you can test its working by
  following these steps:

Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3001/. This will trigger the handleMain function and redirect you to the authorization endpoint.
Log in using your credentials and grant access to the requested scopes. This will redirect you back to the callback URL (http://localhost:3001/login/generic_oauth) with an authorization code in the URL query parameters.
The handleCallback function will be triggered and will exchange the authorization code for an access token and a refresh token. It will then display the access token and refresh token on the page.
